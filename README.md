# Constellate

By [Andres Espineira](https://github.com/amespineira) & [Adriana Galvez](https://github.com/Attacktic)

Have you ever been to an event but later realized you remembered half of the people you met?
Constellate will help you keep track of who you meet and where by displaying notes about each person, what you talked about and more.

Constellate was built as a decoupled app with a [Java back-end](https://github.com/amespineira/q3Project) and Ionic/Angular front-end.
